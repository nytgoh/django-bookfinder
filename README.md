# django-bookfinder
 A simple Django app that utilises the Google Book REST Api to search for books.

## Get Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure python / Django is installed
3. Use ```cd``` to navigate to the django-bookfinder directory that contains ```manage.py``` in it.
4. Run ```python manage.py runserver``` in the terminal to start the server.
5. Once it starts running on your local server, append ```/book/search``` to the url to get to something like ```http://0.0.0.0:8000/book/search/```
6. You should be able to then type something into the search bar and search for a book!
